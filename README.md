## This website gives the users random riddles from the internet

### Features
- Option to show answer if stuck
- Next riddle gets random riddle

### Website is deployed on [UW Student servers](https://students.washington.edu/swifties/riddler/)

### Known bugs/issues 
- Webpage ends early, as if wrapping content, leaving an absurd amount of whitespace

### Notes
- CSS is taken from Github pages page generator
   - That could be causing the issue, but no solution yet.
- Riddles taken off internet, and pasted into a text file
- PHP parses the riddles, and outputs the data in JSON format
- ```.editorconfig``` is used to make code viewing on Github of tab size 4
